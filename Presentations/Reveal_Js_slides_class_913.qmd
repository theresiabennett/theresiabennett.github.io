## 

Practicing Tidyverse Skills

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
library(tidybiology)
#each of these sets has one variable in common - ladder score - so they can be combined!

glimpse(happy)
glimpse(happy_join_one)
glimpse(happy_full)
```

## 

Binding Columns

```{r}
#in order to bind columns, we must see if the fuctions have the same number of rows (they do)
nrow(happy) == nrow(happy_join_one)

bind_cols(happy, happy_join_one)
```

## 

Filtering

```{r}
#filter out all countries from 'happy_full' that are also in 'happy'
#use the filtering join function (in this case, the anti-joint function gives us the right answer)
happy_full %>%
  anti_join(happy)
```
