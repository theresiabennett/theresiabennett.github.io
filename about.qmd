title: "About Me"
---

I am an Appalachian State University Honors student pursuing a degree in Psychology, with a concentration in Health Services, as well as minors in Public Health and Statistics. I have spent the majority of my college career working as a student employee in the Office of Community-Engaged Leadership, and had the opportunity of interning at the Hospitality House of Northwest North Carolina this past summer. I'm currently raising a service dog in training set to turn into the Canine Companions Southeast training center this November! I am currently searching for full-time employment beginning in May 2025. I prefer to spend my free time baking, hiking, and crocheting.

I'd love to connect! Feel free to email me at bennetttl@appstate.edu.
