Perfect for food lovers, this list showcases the locations, cuisines, chefs, and styles of each of the restaurants that have been top rated by the NYTimes. It also includes the restaurant’s address and website URL so interested diners can learn more information or make a trip to the restaurant of their choosing.\nOf the 8 variables included in this list, the categorical measures of city, state, and cuisine_type are going to be the most useful to us.\n\n\n\nLets start by looking at the number of restaurants included in each state.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bar graph showing how many top rated restaurants are in each state.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s visible that California has the most restaurants that made the list, 5, but otherwise this graph isn’t very helpful. Lets simplify it. How many states have restaurants that made the top 50?\n\nrestaurants |&gt;\n  summarize(nds = n_distinct(state))\n\n  nds\n1  28\n\n\nOut of 51 states (since Washington, DC is included), 28 have restaurants included in the NYTimes top 50. Of those states, which had the highest number of restaurants on the list?\n\n\n            state n_restaurants\n1              CA             5\n2              NY             4\n3              CO             3\n4              PA             3\n5              TX             3\n6              FL             2\n7              GA             2\n8              LA             2\n9              MN             2\n10             OR             2\n11             SC             2\n12             TN             2\n13             VA             2\n14 Washington, DC             2\n15             AZ             1\n16             CT             1\n17             IL             1\n18             KY             1\n19             MA             1\n20             MD             1\n21             ME             1\n22             MI             1\n23             NC             1\n24             NJ             1\n25             OH             1\n26             OK             1\n27             RI             1\n28             WA             1\n\n\nIt looks like the most are located in California and New York.\nI wonder, what regions of the US had the most restaurants included?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bar graph showing how many top restaurants are in each region.\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the highest proportion of restaurants, 20, are located in the South, which includes 11 states. The lowest proportion, 4, are located in the midwest, which includes 3 states.\nHere’s another representation of the same data, which may make it easier to see the number of restaurants in each region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Faceted bar graph showing how many top restaurants are in each region.\n\n\n\n\nIn this graph, it is visible that more states are on the list in the South and Northeast than the West and Midwest. Are there any popular cities that contain more than one high-rated restaurant?\n\ncity_count &lt;- restaurants_region %&gt;%\n  count(city, name = \"n_restaurants\") %&gt;%\n  filter(n_restaurants &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_cities = n())\n\nprint(city_count)\n\n  total_cities\n1           10\n\n\nYes, it looks like 10 cities have more than 1 restaurant. Lets find a better way to visualize this.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Plot showing the cities with more than 2 restaurants on the NYTimes list.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many different types of cuisines restaurants on this list serve. Lets see how many types there are.\n\nrestaurants |&gt;\n  summarize(nds = n_distinct(cuisine_type))\n\n  nds\n1  34\n\n\n\n\n            cuisine_type n_cuisine\n1           New American         6\n2                Mexican         4\n3                Seafood         3\n4               Barbecue         2\n5                 Indian         2\n6                 Korean         2\n7                Persian         2\n8               Southern         2\n9             Vietnamese         2\n10                Bistro         1\n11             Cantonese         1\n12    Chinese, Cantonese         1\n13                French         1\n14  French, New American         1\n15       French-Japanese         1\n16             Guamanian         1\n17                 Hmong         1\n18              Indo-Tex         1\n19 Italian, New American         1\n20        Italian, Pizza         1\n21      Kurdish, Turkish         1\n22               Laotian         1\n23             Levantine         1\n24         Mediterranean         1\n25        Nordic Seafood         1\n26  Oyster, New American         1\n27                Polish         1\n28               Raw Bar         1\n29              Scottish         1\n30             Soul Food         1\n31   Soul Food, Southern         1\n32            Steakhouse         1\n33                  Thai         1\n34         Thai, Chinese         1\n\n\n34 different cuisines, with the most being New American. However, some of these cuisine types are mixed or repeated, so lets simplify them and see how many of each are in our new set.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Bar graph showing the types of cuisine, simplified.\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the highest proportion of restaurants serve Asian or American food. Now lets return to the 10 popular cities that had more than 1 top restaurant. What type of cuisine do these city’s restaurants serve?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Faceted bar graph showing the cuisines in cities with more than one restaurant on the NYTimes list.\n\n\n\n\nSo cuisines in Atlanta and Denver are the same, but all other cities have top restaurants with different cuisines. The region label also tells us that most of the top cities are in the South and the West.\nLets see what that graph would look like if we analized by the cuisines in the top states, instead of the top cities. To start, lets see how many states have more than one restaurant.\n\nstates_with_more_than_1 &lt;- restaurants %&gt;%\n    count(state, name = \"num_restaurants\") %&gt;%\n    filter(num_restaurants &gt; 1)\n\nstates_with_more_than_1 %&gt;%\n    arrange(desc(num_restaurants))\n\n            state num_restaurants\n1              CA               5\n2              NY               4\n3              CO               3\n4              PA               3\n5              TX               3\n6              FL               2\n7              GA               2\n8              LA               2\n9              MN               2\n10             OR               2\n11             SC               2\n12             TN               2\n13             VA               2\n14 Washington, DC               2\n\n\n14 states have more than one restaurant, with CA and NY having the most. Only five have more than two so lets focus on these for the next graph. How do these distribute in terms of cuisine?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Faceted bar graph showing the cuisines in states with more than two restaurants on the NYTimes list.\n\n\n\n\nMixed cuisine combinations are really popular in CA, while disproportionate amounts of Asian food are in TX, and more European food is in PA. None of the top 5 most popular states are located in the Midwest.\n\n\nIt appears that only one North Carolina Restaurant made it onto this list. Lets look a little bit more into Good Hot Fish, located in Asheville.\n\n\n  restaurant_name      city state                            address\n1   Good Hot Fish Asheville    NC 10 Buxton Ave, Asheville, NC 28801\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           description\n1 Good Hot Fish is a casual counter service fish fry restaurant inspired by traditional Southern fish camps, offering classic recipes that celebrate Carolina's fishing heritage.

For example, is there a correlation between city population and the scoring of restaurants?\nTo explore this, I decided to upload another dataset and explore some correlations. This dataset, named Population of all US Cities 2024 also comes from Kaggle and was inspected using read.csv.\n\nlibrary(readr)\npopulations &lt;- \n  read.csv(\"./Population of all US Cities 2024.csv\")\n\nglimpse(populations)\n\nRows: 300\nColumns: 8\n$ Rank             &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16…\n$ US.City          &lt;chr&gt; \"New York\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Chicago\", \"Houston\", \"Pho…\n$ US.State         &lt;chr&gt; \"New York\", \"California\", \"Illinois\", \"Texas\", \"Arizo…\n$ Population.2024  &lt;int&gt; 8097282, 3795936, 2638159, 2319119, 1662607, 1533828,…\n$ Population.2020  &lt;int&gt; 8740292, 3895848, 2743329, 2299269, 1612459, 1600684,…\n$ Annual.Change    &lt;dbl&gt; -0.0195, -0.0065, -0.0099, 0.0021, 0.0076, -0.0108, 0…\n$ Density...mile2. &lt;int&gt; 26950, 8068, 11584, 3620, 3208, 11416, 3034, 4260, 38…\n$ Area..mile2.     &lt;dbl&gt; 300.46, 470.52, 227.75, 640.61, 518.33, 134.36, 498.9…\n\n\n8 variables are included, including listed city populations in 2020 and 2024, as well as annual population change, and city and state density and area.\nWe’ll start by combining the datasets. First we need to know what columns they have in common in order to determined how to join them.\n\ncolnames(populations)\n\n[1] \"Rank\"             \"US.City\"          \"US.State\"         \"Population.2024\" \n[5] \"Population.2020\"  \"Annual.Change\"    \"Density...mile2.\" \"Area..mile2.\"    \n\ncolnames(restaurants)\n\n[1] \"restaurant_name\"   \"city\"              \"state\"            \n[4] \"address\"           \"description\"       \"cuisine_type\"     \n[7] \"head_chef_or_lead\" \"website\"          \n\n\nIt looks like city and state are in common, and we want to keep the additional variables from the populations dataset.

However, some of these cuisine types are mixed or repeated, so lets simplify them and see how many of each are in our new set.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Bar graph showing the types of cuisine, simplified.\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like the highest proportion of restaurants serve Asian or American food. Now lets return to the 10 popular cities that had more than 1 top restaurant. What type of cuisine do these city’s restaurants serve?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Faceted bar graph showing the cuisines in cities with more than one restaurant on the NYTimes list.\n\n\n\n\nSo cuisines in Atlanta and Denver are the same, but all other cities have top restaurants with different cuisines. The region label also tells us that most of the top cities are in the South and the West.\nLets see what that graph would look like if we analized by the cuisines in the top states, instead of the top cities. To start, lets see how many states have more than one restaurant.\n\nstates_with_more_than_1 &lt;- restaurants %&gt;%\n    count(state, name = \"num_restaurants\") %&gt;%\n    filter(num_restaurants &gt; 1)\n\nstates_with_more_than_1 %&gt;%\n    arrange(desc(num_restaurants))\n\n            state num_restaurants\n1              CA               5\n2              NY               4\n3              CO               3\n4              PA               3\n5              TX               3\n6              FL               2\n7              GA               2\n8              LA               2\n9              MN               2\n10             OR               2\n11             SC               2\n12             TN               2\n13             VA               2\n14 Washington, DC               2\n\n\n14 states have more than one restaurant, with CA and NY having the most. Only five have more than two so lets focus on these for the next graph. How do these distribute in terms of cuisine?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Faceted bar graph showing the cuisines in states with more than two restaurants on the NYTimes list.\n\n\n\n\nMixed cuisine combinations are really popular in CA, while disproportionate amounts of Asian food are in TX, and more European food is in PA. None of the top 5 most popular states are located in the Midwest.\n\n\nIt appears that only one North Carolina Restaurant made it onto this list. Lets look a little bit more into Good Hot Fish, located in Asheville.\n\n\n  restaurant_name      city state                            address\n1   Good Hot Fish Asheville    NC 10 Buxton Ave, Asheville, NC 28801\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           description\n1 Good Hot Fish is a casual counter service fish fry restaurant inspired by traditional Southern fish camps, offering classic recipes that celebrate Carolina's fishing heritage.
